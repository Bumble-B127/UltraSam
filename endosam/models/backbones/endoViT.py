        Modified to return only x, at multiple stage

        The function supports two kind of forward behaviors. If the ``mask`` is
        ``True``, the function will generate mask to masking some patches
        randomly and get the hidden features for visible patches, which means
        the function will be executed as masked imagemodeling pre-training;
        if the ``mask`` is ``None`` or ``False``, the forward function will
        call ``super().forward()``, which extract features from images without
        mask.


        Args:
            x (torch.Tensor): Input images, which is of shape B x C x H x W.
            mask (bool, optional): To indicate whether the forward function
                generating ``mask`` or not.

        Returns:
            Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]: Hidden features,
            mask and the ids to restore original image.

            - ``x`` (torch.Tensor): hidden features, which is of shape
              B x (L * mask_ratio) x C.
            - ``mask`` (torch.Tensor): mask used to mask image.
            - ``ids_restore`` (torch.Tensor): ids to restore original image.
